Initial Setup
=============

You need one test course with a few activities (fewer than 50) and at least one
custom grade-item in the gradebook; and one test course with many activities
(more than 50), including at least one of each type.

Test script
===========

1.  In the small course, go to Administration -> Reports -> ID numbers.
2.  At the top will be an 'Activity type' selector. This should be set to 'All activities'.
3.  Then there will be a form with sections below for each course section that
    contains relevant activities. At the end all the grade-items in the course
    will be listed.
4.  Each activity that can have an idnumber will be listed with its current idnumber, if any.
5.  Change some activity idnumbers here, then go to the standard edit settings page for that
    activity, and ensure that the changed settings have been saved.
6.  Change some idnumbers in the standard activity settings from, go back to
    the report, and ensure the updated idnumbers are shown there.
7.  For any grade-item related to an activity (e.g. a quiz) make sure that you
    are not allowed to directly change the grade-item idnumber. It should tell you
    to "See above".
8.  Change the idnumber for a custom grade-item. Check that the idnumber changes
    in the gradebook settings form.
9.  Change the idnumber in the gradebook settings form, and go back to the report,
    and verify the idnumber has changed there.
10. Now go the report for the big course. The report will automatically
    swtich to only show one type of activity, to stop the form from being too big.
11. Try switching activity type, and ensure that works.
